These are the questions that I will be answering in my data visuvalisatioon case study
In my case study i will be mainly using matplotlib, seaborn, altire
Some other basic python modules have also been used to modify/change my data/data formate for making visuvalisation easier

1. How does life expectancy vary by continent or income group (low, middle, high income)?
2. What is the relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy across countries?
3. Do countries with higher literacy or school enrollment rates tend to have higher life expectancy?
4. How does healthcare spending as a percentage of GDP affect life expectancy?
5. Is there a visible difference in life expectancy between high CO₂-emitting countries and low emitters?
6. How have life expectancy, healthcare spending, and education evolved over time for selected countries?
7. Which countries spend heavily on healthcare but do not achieve high life expectancy?
8. Do richer countries with higher education spending achieve better health despite emissions?
9. Which countries show the greatest improvement in life expectancy over the last 20 years, and what factors contributed? 
10. Do countries with balanced investment in both education and healthcare outperform those that prioritize only one in terms of life expectancy?
